        <p>Firstly listen to the below wonderful piece composed by <a href="http://www.ludovicoeinaudi.com/" title="Ludovico Einaudi">Ludovico Einaudi</a></p>

<p>Did you notice the talent? The involvement? The fingers moving effortlessly with absolute passion for the tune? The background orchestra supporting like pillars of a beautiful monument? The violins and cellos. This is a thing of a beauty. Now this is one beautiful example of a sincere and a passionate work. Isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>I am a 24 year old aspiring Keyboard student. The truth is, my family has a no background on Music or arts. My ancestors were mostly survivors. And to the almighty&rsquo;s grace and my parents hardwork, I am in this position to atleast start learning now and to appreciate other things. My school days were comfortable but not too much. My parents struggled so much to put all the three of us in school and then into college, and they could not afford to think of anything beyond that.</p>
<p>I first came in touch with this Music and Keyboard in 8th grade, in Dr.RKV school, back in my native Sattur. That year, the school appointed a Music teacher, who came to the school twice in a week to teach some interested students, to play music. I was interested suddenly. I volunteered in my Extracurricular class and reached out to him. There was only one Keyboard in the school.</p>
<p>He taught me, what is an Octave? He gave me the initial drawing with the letters. <strong>CDEFGABC</strong>. After few weeks, he gave me the notes of the song <strong>&ldquo;Suttum Vizhi Sudarae&rdquo;__</strong> from the movie <strong>&ldquo;Ghajini&rdquo;</strong>, which was a huge hit song at that time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile owing to my interest, My dad instantly ordered a Keyboard worth Rs.13000 and gifted me. He used to tell my mom, that &ldquo;Playing music helps relax the mind and elevates one&rdquo;. He has got a wonderful intellect and wisdom that is highly unique among parents.</p>
<p>So I practised the notes for that song in the new keyboard and played it in front of my school, during the Annual day function at my school. Everyone appreciated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There you go. I performed my first ever concert, right in the beginning of my learning. Even though its only one simple song. But heck yeah!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that I was put in to the hostel and thats all. And things also changed at school. My music learning and interest started to diminish. I moved to another residential school for the higher secondary in another town, where the prime focus is on Board examinations. The keyboard was left in my native town, on top of the cupboard left for the rats to eat the thermocoal cups and the paper boxes, that surrounded my keyboard.</p>
<p>And then I came to college in chennai. The four years was absolutely wasted doing useless things. I almost forgot about music and keyboard. My keyboard was still in my native place. One day in my final year of college, suddenly it struck me. I was thinking about my keyboard and my music journey. I went in search of a Leather bag for keyboard and bought it in the city. And when I went back to my native, I was very lucky to find that my Keyboard was in good condition. Only the outer boxes have been terribly damaged by rats. The keyboard was little dirty but worked perfectly. And thanks to the rats coz they left the charger and its wire without eating. <strong>A hugh sigh of relief</strong>.</p>
<p>After two years, I joined a Keyboard class near my workplace. He taught me some basic keyboard music using Tamil classical raagams. He gave me notes in tamil. I learned it for 3 months. But then, I decided I have to change to western. Because working in IT sector, I might have to travel to different places at different point in time. So if I learn in Tamil notes, I might not be able to continue in other states or in other countries. So I joined another place. Its VJ school of Music in Chennai. They teach you western music. And its been 8 months since I have joined there. They teach you with a TRINITY international syllabus. And so far I am learning a lot. Its really good.</p>
<p>Its funny and pleasing to note, that most of the students who come to that school are below 10 years old. I even met a 4 year old who joined the keyboard class. The tutors used to continously ask him to press a button. The boy ends up smiling and looking around and rarely touchin the keyboard. But the most intersting part to note here is, the parents of those young kids are waiting outside of the classroom, looking through the glass walls, watching their children play something. And those kids even take some homework, which have be to completed before the next class.</p>
<p>One of my close <del>friends</del> is a Bharathanatyam dancer. She is a professional now. She has been training since she was a six year old. She used to often say me, how her mother used to push her to classes and force her to commit to learning the art. How much she was supporting her to perceive dance as a passion. I have watched my friend perform in a live show. I used to sit in awe with the colors and the lights and how my friend and her team performs. I always had a huge respect for artists. So she was an inspiration in that aspect.</p>

<p>But nevermind! People say, ** It&rsquo;s never too late **. Its never too late to start some thing good. Its never too late to be grateful and persue some passionate work. I am pretty sure, I would become successful in future with my music. <strong>Because, I understand that I have deep soul driven intution and passion for music. And I have a huge respect for art and creativity.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. My parents were not like those parents with music and art awareness. But they taught me some sincere dedication and kindness in persuing things. My mother taught me what is dedication, with her bhakthi and devotion to God. My father taught me wisdom and Gratitude which led to this current thought</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I might be a beginner in playing music. But I am an expert in listening and appreciating Music. Because I believe in this</p>
<p>__If you want to learn some art, the first step as a grown up, is to have respect towards arts and artists and then to commit and dedicate ourselves to it __</p>
<p>My music education is going in parallel. But that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from creating music. <strong>The below is a piece of Electron Dance MIX that I created recently</strong></p>

<p>P.S I also have some struggle in commiting as a grown up. So I will discuss on how I am overcame that in my next blog. Whatever happens, I am not gonna stop :)</p>
