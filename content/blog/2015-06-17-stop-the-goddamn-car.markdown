[![Oh! Come On !](https://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/cartoon-car-crash.jpg?w=300)](https://vickyexplored.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/cartoon-car-crash.jpg)Ever felt really bad after a stupid argument? over a stupid topic? with your close ones? Ever felt so exhausted after such bad moments and started to regret things? I also have encountered such moments. I recently got an important advice from my dad which was more like a solution to such kind of problems. So I thought I could share it with the world.


<blockquote>He said ,"The most important part of learning to drive a car, is knowing when to and how to stop the car"</blockquote>


I admired these words so much and tried to understand it better. An argument is carried through mood which is very dangerous.Because Mood in technical terms, is not a constant and is actually a variable. So it keeps on changing. So the way we react to situations and to the corresponding people, depends highly on the mood, that we possess at that point in time. So we should be very careful with our words and expressions.

There are three kinds of people. One, who thinks 100% before taking a step. Two, who thinks,while taking a step. Three, who thinks, after taking a step. Of course the first kind are super intelligent. But most of us fall between the last two categories primarily because we can't predict all such situations well ahead. But how can we pull ourselves out of the pit before falling deep? The car driving is a better example for such scenarios. There is a very thin margin between the moment you apply a break and the moment, an accident happens. The very act of arguing might lead to such situations too. Similar to the car driving scenario, there are two actors involved here.

So how to stop the car anyway?

Luckily in the argument scenario, the margin is little bigger than that of the car scenario. The time you might get, to realize that an accident is about to happen is little larger. We would get a lot of clues that the argument, that we are having right now, might get a lot serious.

So I would like to call this point, in time as the **Pinch point**. We can even take this literally. Right at this point we shall pinch ourselves and alert us that we should escape from this. The other clever options that we have is to ask for a **Pause** ! a temporary stop in our argument and ask the target person some time before we can continue. Trust me the intensity will reduce for sure, the next time when u resume the argument. People will feel differently. The pace of it would have been reduced. The mood would have been changed. Time has the greatest power to change the mood. Give the argument, a break. And then resume it later.

This is one simple way of avoiding such accidents in arguments, that I have learned.

P.S: I myself, is a beginner in following this new strategy. But I am sure, I would become good in due time.
