In the past few years, I paid a very close attention to my stomach and things I ate. Here are the points I discovered that was very helpful to myself. 


* The less, the size of the meal I have, the more I feel alert and at ease after eating. 

* Eating two course meal everyday elevates my concentration at work. Especially having a brunch in the morning at around 11AM and dinner around 7PM, with a 3:30 to 4pm small snack break. 

* Skipping Lunch makes me more focussed in the afternoon sessions. I experimented with just having a small cup of fruits (say 5 to 6 pieces) or just an apple alone. With this, I found myself to be more productive and alert in the afternoon sessions at work. 

* Avoiding the combo and opting for a single item of food. This had been a signficant discovery, that really helped me. For example, when I go for team lunches with my office colleagues, Usually people opt for standard set meals, which are basically cost effective combos that include a soup, a maincourse and a drink. I started just buying maincourse separately and ignore soup and a drink often, even if its not cost effective. And this has been great. Just one meal and not mixing with things. **This made my stomach feel very light, after eating**

* Not drinking water right after eating. And taking a minimum of 45 minutes to 1 hour before I drink water. And when I do, I dont drink small sips of water regularly. Rather, I drink close to 400ml of water and take a break of few hours before I drink my next big portion. **This I still donot understand and articulate the benefits that I can get. But I can only feel it** 

* **The way I ate seemed more important to me, than what I ate**. I found that, whenever I had some food gracefully, I feel very light after eating. But whenever I had my food out of hurry to go to office, or as part of a discussion over some thing (eg. office team lunch), I dont feel that light weighted stomach. 

* **How much I ate seemed more important to me**. Even if its delicious home made food or quick oily fast food, eating half or quarter less than a full meal, makes me feel alive, even after eating. 

* Usually I ended up being the last person to finish eating during team lunches. I eat really slowly. I dont like galloping. Rather, I started taking time. Even if I was eating pizza, I prefer to have it slowly. 

* My **listening ability** in the conversations with colleagues or in meetings at office become less effective if my stomach does not feel good either by eating too much or by improper bowel movements. 

* Also **my awareness and ability to pay more attention** gets affected, if my stomach is not at ease, due to some bad treatments to it.
