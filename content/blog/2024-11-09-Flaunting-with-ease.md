why are you not grounded? why is there a tinge of high,<br>
and nervousness?<br><br><br>

did you dress up for the party?<br><br><br>

or did you just want to express ur uniqueness?<br><br><br>

that you are unique and different from peers.<br><br><br>

different from your class mates.<br><br><br>

different from your college mates.<br><br><br>

different among your work mates.<br><br><br>

why?<br><br><br>

the word flaunting struck you.<br><br><br>

why?<br><br><br>

may be you are really flaunting?<br><br><br>

the excitement before the party, you assumed it was<br><br><br>

from the 3 fried eggs.<br><br><br>

but is it? it went suddenly after the party.<br><br><br>

is it wrong to flaunt?<br><br><br>

is it wrong to create a scene?<br><br><br>

is it wrong to constantly try to look/be/do different?<br><br><br>

No.<br><br><br>

But why a bit of struggle for the preparation?<br><br><br>

why all the mental cycles of various scenarios<br>
and various interactions?<br><br><br>

and possible solutions to those.<br><br><br>

Isn't it too heavy?<br><br><br>

Is it worth the few brief moments of fleeting high?<br><br><br>

could you flaunt without a single drop of stress or high?<br><br><br>

could you be different naturally?<br><br><br>

could be at ease at all junctions of the show day?<br>
at the beginning?<br>
right at the beginning?<br><br><br>

at the middle?<br><br><br>

during the event?<br><br><br>

infront of the pretty folks?<br><br><br>

infront of the colleagues and peers?<br><br><br>

infront of the family?<br><br><br>

can there be a show, to express your authentic<br>
original inclinations without a single dose of conflict?<br><br><br>

How will that look?<br><br><br>

How deeply relaxing will it be?<br><br><br>

How truly original will it be?<br><br><br>

Is it possible to live that way?<br><br><br>

Can you sing that song without a single dose of conflict?<br>
at any junctions of the party?<br>
at the beginning?<br>
during the event?<br>
at the end?<br><br><br>
