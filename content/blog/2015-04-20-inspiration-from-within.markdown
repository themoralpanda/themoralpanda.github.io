In my opinion, clearly no person other than Steve Jobs will be remembered by the world for what he did to technology and design. No other batsman other than Sachin Tendulkar is rightly portrayed to be the 'God of Cricket' for what he did to the game and for Indian cricket. No one other than Narayana Murthy will be appreciated in India as much for being a role model and perfect entrepreneur in the Indian IT industry. So we are easily inspired by all these success stories. Most of us will appreciate their work and efforts and move on. Some of us take a step further and try following the ideas and principles of these great achievers. Some of us build a huge wish list to achieve things, the way these individuals have done. I wanted to do that too. So I sat down to think about building a plan to accomplish it. All I could get were the various examples for great achievements like I mentioned above. So how should I come up with a practical protocol for this?

After thinking for a while, I realized that those individuals who amazed me were also one among us at some point in time, but with a few differences – the passion for some specific thing and a desperate perseverance to achieve it. All I see is the image of all these people after reaching that point, after becoming successful.

**We are inspired by these people but how did they get inspiration before they had tasted success?**

I finally discovered that one factor that I have been missing! It’s ‘**Inspiration from within**’. All those success stories will motivate us but the inspiration from within is responsible for making us work. The belief that we are going to get things done will make us work hard. We have to visualize ourselves being there, tasting success. The belief that there is something out there waiting for us is of high importance.

So how do we get inspired from within?

The only person who knows you the best,  is yourself. Inspiration from within comes in to making us perfect in the way we perform. We should find various aspects of ourselves that needs to be improved, that needs to be whitewashed and taken care of. If we keep improving ourselves in this way, with our prime aspiration in mind, we will be able to make it. In every step of our routine, we have to make sure that we are on the right path and ensuring that our effort and work for today are better than that of yesterday. The prime focus should be on changing ourselves without worrying about the surrounding.


<blockquote>The Nature has gifted us all with three eyes basically. Two among them are used to see the world around us. The third one is to see within us .Lets unlock the third eye! And get inspired !</blockquote>


This is the practical protocol that I could come up in perceiving success. Let’s get in there! And get it done!

Let’s dive into ourselves, start exploring, believing and improving. Let’s get it started!
