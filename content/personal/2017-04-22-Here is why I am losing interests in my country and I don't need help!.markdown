I am an Indian. A 24 year old. Spent all my 24 years so far in India except few vacations. Right through my school days, I was taught Patriotism via books, Prayers, Sports routines and early celebrations of historically important days. During those days, I felt it. The pride, the energy and the importance. But as I grew up and became an adult and especially after the arrival of the social media, I am slowly feeling the reality.

I am not loosing interests because of Government. Because, they are doing what they have been doing and they will be doing the same. So Never mind!

Its not because of the Celebrities either. They are also doing the same thing that they have been doing all the time. Pretending to be a beacon at the sea shore but flickering like a useless street lamp.

I am annoyed because of the People. I am loosing patriotism because of the my brothers and sisters out there. The People. Here is why.

1. People ask for "No Reservation!". But they don't fight for "No Castes". Because No Reservation means all people are equal. Then why not fight for "No Caste" as a whole. If people are so proud of who they are and what caste they belong to, how can they ask for "No Reservation", which ultimately says, that all people are equal.
2. One religion accuses other religion of spreading their religion. But they themselves post, "In order to have a beautiful life, say the mantras of this God", in almost all the MTC buses.
3. And the children are becoming desperate when it comes to Love. And the parents are becoming desperate when it comes to Marriage.
4. Epic pilgrimages underwent. Infinite discourses about God, has been spread. Truck load of comments about the society. Yet, people don't stop commenting about others values.
5. The same actor, who talks great about, women and respect towards them, dances for an item song, in every fucking movie.
6. One week before, they accuse him of knowing nothing about politics and condemns him from entering in to politics, and exactly one week later, call him "Thalaivaaaa" posting a picture from his upcoming movie.
7. Some build apartments in every little lakes. Many buy a comfortable home in the same apartment. And all complain about water scarcity and Government's measures on it.
8. They say, discrimination of any form, is an offense. But all discrimination of all kinds, happens inside the homes. They can't even stand up against their own parent's societal values.
9. A single person drives a Sedan alone, daily to office, and complains about Pollution in the city.
10. They worry so much about U.S coming out of Paris climate change treaty, but continue cutting trees and conquer lakes. 
11. A cow is an holy animal whereas a chicken is a Satan's curse.
12. If animals know about the purspose of dustbins, then I bet that they would not throw away anything on the roads.  

The lists goes on and on.

The real change that is required in India, is the change in people's mind.
